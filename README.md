This is the second version of the N-body simulator originally created by James Price (https://github.com/jrprice/NBody-Metal) 

Educational N-body simulation with visualisation for exploring:
- nature of gravity and chaos 
- the use of Metal programming framework for computational physics on OS X

Version 2.0  by Piotr Nowak includes:
- reacher user interface
- configurable initial distribution of bodies
- configurable initial velocity of bodies
- configurable softening

### Usage

RL = Random
R0 = value of 0

Choose CRR for both Initial Distribution and Initial Velocity to experiment with rotating planetary disks.
Combine RSS, RSC and RC to form a sphere or spin the particles.
Use CR to cut the space filled with bodies in any way.

### Developer Usage

With Xcode 10+, this project should cleanly build and run without any modifications.

The `d` key can be used to cycle through Metal devices.

The number of bodies can be increased and decreased with the `+` and `-` keys.
